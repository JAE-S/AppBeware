When we noticed that our daughter was becoming active online and getting more of an attitude with everyone we started looking into her activity online and I have to say that I am so glad we did. She was cursing, getting sexual post tags from her 11 year old friends, saying sexual things to teenage YouTube heart throbs which she was instructed by them to do via a request to the masses of obsessed girls (she didn’t know it but it was really bad) …. The list goes on, she wasnt doing drugs or getting sexual thankfully but it was a path that she could go down. So we intervened and we continue to do so. I am not saying we examine every single post or message but a glance here and there doesn’t hurt and in our case it was a wakeup call.','alert': true,'UserId': '2', 'ListedAppId': '1' //snapchat

He told a friend that he was chatting with at that time, of the harassment and that some idiot had just sent him disgusting pictures. The friend asked to see them and he sent them via text message then promptly deleted them. When the police were called for the harassment issues which included threats of rape and battery, they found the deleted photos and arrested my son, who was in fact the victim of threats and sexual harassment!

There are a TON of bullies 4. There are a TON of catfishes ~Details~ So I have had this app for a year and I regret it so much. I accumulated a following of about 15k people (Man, I was dumb) and I have had my fair share of everything. People say the worst thing about this app is comparing celebrities to each other but I had had about five cyberbullies cuss me out (f***k, s***t, b****h, the whole set). I have also had about ten seven year old girls tell me I was hot and attempted to send me pictures. Even worse, a bunch of people tried to take pictures of me that I posted and use it to get their own gaggle of fangirls. One time a crazy girl even found out my last name even though I never released it. PLEASE DO NOT LET YOUR CHILD GET THIS APP, PLEASE. I REGRET IT, AND YOU WILL REGRET IT.
